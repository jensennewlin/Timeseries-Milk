# Timeseries-Milk
Researched milk production to determine trends to predict future needs since the U.S. population is always increasing. Started 
with a decomposition plot to confirm there was a trend, seasonality, and changing variance. Transformed the data and then 
picked a model that best fit to predict future outcomes. Applied Box-Cox transformation, detrending, and deseasonalizing 
to help us create a stationary model. Fit multiple SARIMA models using AICc to determine our final model.
